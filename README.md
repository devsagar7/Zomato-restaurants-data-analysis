Explore Bangalore's restaurant scene with my data analyst project, where I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn. By analyzing factors such as location, online ordering trends, and cuisine popularity, I uncovered valuable insights to guide strategic decision-making for opening new restaurants in underserved areas. Join me as we navigate through data to unlock opportunities in Bangalore's dynamic food industry.
